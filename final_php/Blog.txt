Author:Ayanabha Chatterjee...Desc:PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor) is a free, open-source scripting language that's often used for web development. It's designed to be dynamic and can be embedded into HTML. PHP code is enclosed in special start and end processing instructions, <?php and ?>, and is executed on the server. The server then generates HTML and sends it to the client's web browser, allowing the user to interact with the page. END..
